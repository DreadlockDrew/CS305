Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Who was the customer? What problem were you supposed to address?
A consulting company called Artemis Financial creates unique financial strategies for its clients. They engaged us to create their open-source web application and make it secure enough to handle the delicate financial and personal information contained therein.


What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

I performed a good job using static testing to find the current vulnerabilities in the code base. Secure coding is crucial to preventing data theft and preserving the company's integrity and dependability image.
What about the vulnerability assessment procedure did you find challenging or beneficial?
By automatically identifying vulnerabilities rather than having to manually check each dependency for vulnerabilities, the dependency check tool was incredibly helpful and helped save a lot of time.



How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

Penetration testing should be required in the future to more accurately identify vulnerabilities.
If new dependencies were introduced, the dependency check had to be re-run. Otherwise, functionality can be ensured through manual code revision and unit testing.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I found it very helpful to use the Internet to study current procedures and algorithms.
